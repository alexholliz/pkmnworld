# PKMN World

## The Basics

### PKMN World

This is a game about tests and causes, travelling far and wide, and exploring the power within. Where the various rank and file monsters exist in that TV show space of "more intelligent than their direct human-world comparison, but still not human-level intelligence" and the rare ones are just-as or more intelligent than humans. Which is, I realize, kind of what the movies do.

In this world, Trainers don't "catch" creatures, they partner with them, travel with them, and figure out how to stop Kyogre and Groudon from fighting.

This game is intended to be set in the legendary history of the franchise, long before the setting of the TV Show, the games, or the manga. That doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't play it in a modern setting, just that you might need to brew some more of your own content.

Each player should highlight two of their stats: one chosen by another player, and one chosen by the MC. The character's development over time is dependent on those stats.

### Why to Play

One: Because characters are fun and interesting.

Two: Because fun and interesting characters become _more_ fun and interesting when they interact with other characters. The conflict in motivation, rivals, friends, and enemies make the experience richer.

Three: Because the characters are exploring a dangerous, untamed world together. They'll find places no one has ever seen before. They'll uncover mysteries that explore the origins of trainers and creatures. They'll push into the wilderness, and figure out if they're tough enough when the wilderness pushes back.

Four: Because they may be together, but do they stay together when they're under pressure? This is a world where trainers might not be welcome in places they want to explore, and their partners might not be welcome either. Who has your back when you want to press forward, and what if you get it wrong?

Five: Because no one else is going out there. Being the best there ever was doesn't come to you when you're sitting around. You have to challenge the world to test yourself. Your legend is about to unfold! A world of dreams and adventures awaits, let's go! 

## Playbooks

## Character Creation

Consider the type of game you want to play. PKMN World is flexible enough to let you play pretty much any experience, the sky is the limit. The following are just examples based on existing portrayals.

* The Anime Version: Trainers may not need a playbook, creatures definitely do. Players might want to play this way to match the TV Show or Movies, where the humans are there to move the story forward and have personal interactions; while the creatures actually perform all the tasks to get their humans out of a jam.

* Mystery Dungeon: There are no trainers, creatures have playbooks, and operate without human interaction. Players might want to play this way if they want to roleplay as the creatures themselves, and tell stories that don't need to focus on human problems, or treat humans and human expansion into the natural world as a threat.

* Gym Leader: Trainers and creatures have playbooks, and each player controls 2 characters. Players may want to play this way if they want to emulate some of the NPC trainers from the main series games, or the manga. Where the trainer and a specific creature are bonded as adventuring partners.

### Origin

Creature or Trainer, you come from somewhere, and that place is going to have some effect on your personality, ways of interacting, and outlook on other trainers and creatures. The following are some examples, but you can (and should) make your own.

* Kanto Region: Kanto is untamed grassland, with a few large cities dotting the landscape. Trade and travel between cities and settlements follow mostly natural routes through forests, mountains, and caves. Creatures from Kanto lean towards the Powers of Grass, Rock, and Fire. Trainers from Kanto tend to be independent, headstrong, and always looking to prove themselves.

* Johto Region: Johto is an ancient human capital. There are layers of creature and trainer structures and warrens to explore. Creatures from the Johto region tend toward Ghost, Bird, and Dragon Powers. Trainers from the region can be mysterious, close-knit, and willing to help someone in need.
